// Node is anything the graph stores under a key: the entities (facts, topics,

//
// A node's key is the hash of its own type tag followed by its material —
// "fact:", "topic:", "entity:", "mentions:", "isabout:" — so identity is
// (type, value), never value alone: a fact and a topic that read the same are
// two different nodes. Without the tag, `remember 'billing' topic:billing`
// hashes both to one key, and then the topic node is never stored (Set finds
// the fact already there) while its IsAbout edge points from the fact back to
// itself. A new participant takes a tag that no other one prefixes; the five
// above differ in their first byte.

// which keeps a node type that has no provenance from having to answer for
