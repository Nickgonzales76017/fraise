    else (e.g. a leading term that spells a grammar keyword). Empty on the
    common, unambiguous path.

    ``empty`` is about the graph, not the result set — ``bool(result)`` is what
    reports whether anything came back. It separates the two ways a recall comes
    back with nothing: False is the ordinary miss, where the graph holds facts
    and none of them matched, so the query is what to change; True means the
    graph searched holds nothing at all — no fact has ever been written to it —
    and no rephrasing would have helped. The server carries the difference in
    the status line (204 for the empty graph), because the two were otherwise
    the same empty result set, and a caller could not tell a graph it had never
    written to from a question it had asked badly.
