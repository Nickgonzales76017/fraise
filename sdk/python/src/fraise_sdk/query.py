"""Builders that turn structured arguments into Fraise query strings.

These are pure functions with no I/O, so they are the natural unit-test seam:
the wire format lives here, and :mod:`fraise_sdk.client` only concerns itself
with transport. The grammar they target:

    remember@<graph> '<value>' [topic:<t>]... [entity:<e>]... [vec:$<name>]
    recall@<graph> <keyword>... [topic:<t>]... [entity:<e>]...
                   [top:<n>] [depth:<n>] [vec:$<name>]

The vector itself never appears in the string — the caller sends it out of band
in the request ``parameters`` map, and only the ``vec:$<name>`` placeholder is
emitted here.
